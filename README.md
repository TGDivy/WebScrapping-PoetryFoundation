# WebScrapping-PoetryFoundation

Extracting all the poems from Poetry Foundation, using Selenium, Beautiful Soup and Multiprocessing in Python.

The dataset extracted contains the:
<li>Poem</li>
<li>Poem's Title</li>
<li>Poet</li>
<li>Tags</li>
<br><br>
The dataset was created with intention for Artificial Poem Generation. It could be used for various other NLP tasks like classification, and semantic analysis. I hope, that dataset is helpful!<br><br>
